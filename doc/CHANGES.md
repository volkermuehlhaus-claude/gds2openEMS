New option `settings['resonance_estimation']`: shorter simulations with accurate low-frequency results.

openEMS ends a simulation when the energy left in the model has dropped below `energy_limit`. With the usual −40 dB, this can be too early for inductors and capacitors, and their low-frequency values come out wrong: for example, an inductor's low-frequency resistance 20 % too low. −60 dB gives the right result, but takes longer. With resonance estimation, gds2openEMS predicts how the simulation would continue, ends it as soon as the predicted result no longer changes, and includes the prediction in the result.

```python
settings['energy_limit'] = -60            # the simulation ends here at the latest
settings['resonance_estimation'] = True   # end earlier, once the result no longer changes
```

- In tests with inductors, a MIM capacitor and PA core layouts, the simulations took 0.45–0.85× as long as with −60 dB alone. For the inductors and the capacitor, the results were as accurate as with −60 dB or better.
- Layouts that are already accurate at −40 dB, such as transistor and PA core layouts, end right after the excitation, with about −40 dB accuracy.
- If the prediction is not reliable, the simulation continues, or the normal result is used. The file `resonance_estimation.txt` in each `sub-N` output folder says what happened.
- Models with field dumps are not ended early.
- The option is off by default; without it, nothing changes.

See [Resonance estimation](userguide_md_format/Using_OpenEMS_Python_with_IHP_SG13G2_v3.md#resonance-estimation-stop-when-the-result-has-converged) in the user's guide, and the example [`more_examples/resonance_estimation`](../more_examples/resonance_estimation/README.md), which shows the problem and the results step by step.

Fixed `utilities.write_snp()` for models with 3 or more ports: the Touchstone files contained the transposed S-matrix (S11 S21 S31 … instead of S11 S12 S13 …), all on one line. The Touchstone format requires the matrix row by row for 3 and more ports, each row on a new line and at most 4 value pairs per line. Programs that read these files (e.g. scikit-rf, circuit simulators) therefore got S21 where S12 belongs. For reciprocal structures the difference is small (in the examples up to 0.015 at 350 GHz), but it is wrong in principle. 1-port and 2-port files are unchanged. To correct an existing 3+-port file, run the model script again: the simulation is skipped (unchanged model, see [the hash-based skip](userguide_md_format/Using_OpenEMS_Python_with_IHP_SG13G2_v3.md#re-running-a-model-the-hash-based-skip)) and the Touchstone file is written again from the existing data.

The PDF user's guide is now generated from the Markdown user's guide [`userguide_md_format/Using_OpenEMS_Python_with_IHP_SG13G2_v3.md`](userguide_md_format/Using_OpenEMS_Python_with_IHP_SG13G2_v3.md), which is the only source from now on: `python doc/pdf_build/build_userguide_pdf.py`, see [`pdf_build/README.md`](pdf_build/README.md). A GitHub workflow builds the PDF when the guide changes and attaches it to each release.

## 02-Oct-2026

Via array merging (`merge_polygon_size > 0`) could short different metal shapes: closely spaced via arrays that connect different metal shapes above or below merged into one via. Now a merged via region that touches more than one metal shape above or below is built again: its vias are grouped by the metal shapes they connect, each group is merged on its own and clipped to the overlap of its metal shapes. The metal layers above and below each via layer come from the XML stackup. Vias without metal above or below stay unmerged. Merged vias that do not connect different metal shapes are not changed, so models without this problem give the same results as before.

## 28-Sep-2026

New study [L6n2 inductor with openEMS vs. measurement](../more_examples/measured_vs_simulated/more_accurate_models_L6n2/README.md): step by step from the default model to a result within 3% of the measured low-frequency resistance and 0.1% of the measured SRF, with via fill factor correction, the energy end criterion (use −60 dB, or at least −50 dB, for low-frequency R), a passivation cut stackup, and a comparison with gds2palace.

Rewrote the z mesher `util_meshlines.create_z_mesh()`. Metal subdivision lines now respect dielectric interfaces inside a metal, and z lines closer than 1 nm are merged. The old code created unnecessarily small cells in some cases: 0.1 µm instead of 0.4 µm for the [L6n2](../more_examples/measured_vs_simulated/more_accurate_models_L6n2/README.md) passivation-cut stackup at 0.8–1.4 µm `refined_cellsize`, and sub-picometer cells from floating point noise in `Reference=` stackups with the MIM layer. Both force a very small FDTD time step. For standard stackups, the z mesh is unchanged. A scan over all example stackups and `refined_cellsize` 0.3–3 µm changed only the cases with these artifacts. The previous function is still available as `create_z_mesh_legacy`, see [Meshing](userguide_md_format/Using_OpenEMS_Python_with_IHP_SG13G2_v3.md#meshing).

`settings['air_around']` as a 6-element list `[xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax, zmin, zmax]` now works, as the user guide already stated. Previously the mesh functions only accepted a single value and failed on a list.

`setupSimulation()` now warns when a field dump's `source_layernum` has no polygons. The dump box then silently covered the bounding box of the entire layout, which happens when the dump layer was not passed to `read_gds()`. The fix is to add `layernumbers.extend(field_dumps.dumplayers)` before `read_gds()`; the [Field dumps](userguide_md_format/Using_OpenEMS_Python_with_IHP_SG13G2_v3.md#field-dumps) section now says so.

`settings[]` keys are now case-insensitive, e.g. `settings['numthreads']` works like `settings['numThreads']`. Previously a key in the wrong case was silently ignored and the default used. `setupSimulation()` prints a note for each key used in a different case, and a warning if both spellings are set with different values; the canonical spelling wins.


## 27-Sep-2026

New option `settings['fill_factor_correction']` (default `False`), ported from gds2palace: with via array merging (`merge_polygon_size > 0`), the conductivity of each merged via polygon is multiplied by its via fill factor (original via area / merged area, rounded to 2 decimals), because the stackup via conductivity is derived from the per-via resistance. Scaled vias get their own material, e.g. `TopVia2_x0.49`. See [Input files](userguide_md_format/Using_OpenEMS_Python_with_IHP_SG13G2_v3.md#input-files). With the option off, the generated model is unchanged.

Stackup Editor (`stackup_editor/`), ported from setupEM:

- **Stackup Preview**: metals that extend past the dielectric boundary above are drawn up to their true height, and the distance to that boundary shows as a negative value in red instead of 0. A dielectric fill layer anchored to a metal (`Reference=`, e.g. conformal passivation) is drawn at its real position, straddling the boundaries it crosses, in its own amber color; one that overlaps another conductor is flagged in orange.
- Saving a stackup without a file extension appends `.xml`.
- The editor pins a light color scheme, so it stays readable on Windows accounts with dark mode enabled.

## 22-Sep-2026

The [hash-based skip](userguide_md_format/Using_OpenEMS_Python_with_IHP_SG13G2_v3.md#re-running-a-model-the-hash-based-skip) in `runSimulation()` now also hashes the calling model script itself (up to and including the `runSimulation()` call), not just the generated CSX file. This catches changes to solver-runtime settings like `numThreads` or `EndCriteria` that never end up in the CSX file and were previously missed, causing stale results to be silently reused. Code after the call (post-processing, plotting, ...) is still excluded from the hash, so editing that still doesn't force a re-solve. Existing `simulation_model.hash` files from before this change will mismatch once, forcing one re-simulation per cached result.

## 12-Sep-2026

Added two reserved stackup materials that need no `<Materials>` entry: `PEC` (ideal conductor, on conductor/via/sheet Layers, modeled with `CSX.AddMetal`) and `AIR` (built-in default dielectric, overridable). Also supported in the Stackup Editor (`stackup_editor/`).

Ported the Stackup Editor's Layers-tab column-header click-to-sort (Name alphabetically, Zmin/Zmax resulting position largest-first) from setupEM, closing a gap since this repo's editor was forked off.

## 03-Sep-2026

Added a graphical **Stackup XML Editor** (`pip install gds2openEMS` now also installs a `stackupEditor` console command). Covers Variables, Materials, the Dielectric stack, drawn Layers, Reference-relative positioning, Derived Layers, and Thermal Tables, with a live cross-section preview, undo, and an "Import from ADS Momentum" option (`*.subst`/`*.ltd`). `PySide6` is now a dependency of `gds2openEMS`.

This is a port of the equivalent editor from the sibling `gds2palace_ihp_sg13g2`/`setupEM` project, re-pointed at this repo's own `util_stackup_reader.py` (identical XML schema, independently-maintained reader) - a new top-level `stackup_editor/` package, a separate copy, not shared code with setupEM's original.

## 02-Sep-2026

New user's guide, v3

Migrated all 10 `workflow/run_*.py` examples to the `settings{}` dictionary syntax and the `gds2openEMS` PyPI package (`from gds2openEMS import *`), instead of loose top-level variables and a local `modules/` copy. Behavior is unchanged.

This was really two separate things that had gotten tangled together: which code you use (a local `modules/` copy vs. `pip install gds2openEMS`) and which coding style you use (loose variables vs. `settings{}`). They're independent. README.md now documents them as two separate choices.

Removed the `postprocess_only` switch from all example model scripts. It's no longer needed: `runSimulation()` already skips the FDTD solve automatically via a content hash of the model. If the model hasn't changed since the last run, it just reuses the existing result. 

Added `more_examples/local_modules_copy/`, a fully self-contained example (its own `modules/` copy, GDSII layout, and XML stackup) demonstrating the local-copy distribution method on its own. 

`util_simulation_setup.py` module load `import shapely` now fails with a clear error message if shapely module is missing. 

`voltage=0` ports are now actually skipped in scripts that build their excitation list from `simulation_ports.all_active_excitations()`, saving simulation time instead of wasting it. Referencing a never-excited port's S-parameters now fails with a clear error instead of crashing.

Added `scripts/sync_local_modules_copy.py`, so `more_examples/local_modules_copy/modules/` (used to demonstrate the local `modules` folder method) doesn't silently drift out of sync with the canonical source. Run it whenever `workflow/modules/` changes.


## 01-Sep-2026
Fixed a crash in `resolve_derived_layers()`: `gdspy.boolean()` raises `IndexError` when called with an empty operand (e.g. a resistor recognition layer with no polygons in the current cell), which previously aborted the whole GDSII read. The boolean fold now short-circuits using the OR/AND/NOT identity instead whenever either operand is empty. Same fix applied to gds2palace_ihp_sg13g2's independent copy of this reader.

Added a new example, `more_examples/parameterized_XML_stackup`, showing how to override stackup `<Variable>`s (`total_thickness`, `air_thickness`) from a model script via `read_substrate(variable_overrides=...)`, in both the loose top-level variable style and the `settings{}` dictionary style.

## 20-Aug-2026
Corrected a license inconsistency: the repository's LICENSE file said Apache-2.0, while every source file's own header comment already said GPLv3. The code headers were correct — this workflow directly imports and drives the GPLv3-licensed openEMS solver object in-process, with no linking exception covering that use, so GPLv3 is the license actually required here. LICENSE, `pyproject.toml`, and the remaining files that were missing a header now all agree on GPLv3.

The `gds2openEMS` PyPI package can now be built directly with `python -m build` from this repository (`pyproject.toml` at the repo root, publishing `workflow/modules/` under the `gds2openEMS` name), instead of maintaining a separate manually-synced copy.

Fixed `write_snp()` writing a hardcoded 50 Ohm reference impedance into the Touchstone (`*.snp`) file header regardless of the actual port impedance used in the simulation. All model scripts now pass the real port reference impedance from `simulation_ports`, so the header correctly reflects non-50 Ohm setups (e.g. differential/GSG ports).

## 13-18-Aug-2026
Added support for derived layers in the stackup XML format, with a new IHP resistor example under `more_examples`.

The stackup reader (`util_stackup_reader.py`) now supports a `<Variables>` block and `=`-prefixed expressions, ported from gds2palace_ihp_sg13g2's reader to keep the two independent copies in sync. This allows a stackup XML file to define named values that other attributes can reference, instead of repeating the same physical value in multiple places.

Keyhole/hole polygons are now split before CSXCAD extrusion, fixing incorrect geometry for layers with holes. This requires the `shapely` package, now a documented dependency.

## 12-Jul-2026
Added `calculate_Zij()` for multiport Z-parameter extraction (previously only available for 2-port).

## 19-Jun-2026
New `numThreads` workflow option to force the number of openEMS solver threads, instead of relying on automatic thread count detection. Two examples are provided in the `more_examples` folder.
